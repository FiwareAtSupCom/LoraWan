# LoraWan
Deploiement d'un r√©seau IoT lorawan Multitenant sur le technopole ElGhazala
# Project Description
Deployment of a Lorawan Multitenant IoT network on the ElGhazala technopole
This involves installing 3 gateways connected to the ChirpStack network server.
For a user to exploit the network, simply he should ask the admin to create a tenant on Chirpstack
and assign it as admin to that tenant. The admin adds shared gateways to all tenants.
Now the user can create applications and can add the end-devices associated to his application.
This project targets all students, PhD students and teachers of Sup'Com as well as professionals in partnership.

# LoraWan Technology
The LoRaWAN protocol is a Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) communication protocol that functions on LoRa. The LoRaWAN specification is open so anyone can set up and operate a LoRa network.

LoRa is a wireless audio frequency technology that operates in a license-free radio frequency spectrum. LoRa is a physical layer protocol that uses spread spectrum modulation and supports long-range communication at the cost of a narrow bandwidth. It uses a narrow band waveform with a central frequency to send data, which makes it robust to interference.

# Architecture ChirpStack
The gateway contains the UDP packet forwarder that forwards packets coming from the lora physical layer to the chorpstack gateway bridge and next to the MQTT broker that communicates with the network server.
The network server can exchange events with the client application through integrations(HTTP, MQTT, InfluxDB...).

# Seeeduino lorawan gateway kit
This kit provides all the basic elements you need: a Raspberry Pi 3, a Seeeduino LoRaWAN with GPS and a gateway & local server that allows you to collect and transfer data among all your LoRa nodes.

# Testing on local Chirpstack server.
We've installed chirpstack V4.0 on a Docker container in our pc to test the connectivity.
For that we made a test application and we've successfully linked the gateway's packet forwarder to the neetwork server(IP Address/port),
We've also created a device (OTAA mode) and sent some testing data (even with a script and an actual sensor).

# OTAA vs APB
They are both device activation modes.
-Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) - the most secure and recommended activation method for end devices. Devices perform a join procedure with the network, during which a dynamic device address is assigned and security keys are negotiated with the device.
-Activation By Personalization (ABP) - requires hardcoding the device address as well as the security keys in the device. ABP is less secure than OTAA and also has the downside that devices can not switch network providers without manually changing keys in the device.

These are the parameters used in each mode:
-OTAA:
Each device has 64-bit DEV-EUI(public/unique/comes with the manufacturer) and an app-key(private/chosen by user) that must be kept secret. They are both shared to the device and to the server.
-APB:
Each device has 64-bit DEV-EUI and an app-session-key(chosen by user), dev_address(chosen by user) and network-session-key(chosen by user), they are all
shared to the device and to the server manually.
NB: In both modes there is also App-EUI but it is not used by Chirpstack.

# Deployment of Chirpstack 4.0 in the Sup'Com server (VPN)

# Using STM32-discovery-B-L072Z-LRWAN1 board as an end device
1- Download STM32CubeFunctionPack_LORA1_V2.2.0 from ST website which contains all the drivers / middleware / libraries needed to use the Lora module of the card.
2- Open the example application provided in projects folder(we used stm32 cube ide).
3- Open "Comissionning" file, we've chosen to use static DEV-EUI mode, we set STATIC_DEVICE_EUI to 1 to enable this mode.
Then, we've chosen a random LORAWAN_DEVICE_EUI and set it in chirpstack. We created a device with an appKey in chirpstack.
We take this app key and we assign it to LORAWAN_APP_KEY in the "Comissionning" file.
